# RT-SB-SWITCHED-XSHELL-FREERTOS-MULTI

Multi-target XHAL sandbox host running two static sandboxes with switched MPU
regions:

- SB1 runs the ChibiOS/RT XSHELL client (`demos/various/SB-CLIENT-RT-XHAL-XSHELL`).
  It owns the console UART through VIO UART unit 0, VRQ 8.
- SB2 runs the FreeRTOS client (`demos/various/SB-CLIENT-FREERTOS`). It owns
  the board LED through VIO GPIO unit 0 and, on targets defining one, a
  serial port through VIO UART unit 0, VRQ 8. Its standard input, output and
  error are connected to `/dev/null`.

The host restarts a sandbox when it terminates and reports the exit code on
its serial port. The host port can be shared with the SB1 console, the host
starts it again before reporting because the sandbox cleanup stops it.

Targets: STM32G474RE Nucleo-64, STM32H563ZI Nucleo-144.

## FreeRTOS sandbox behavior

At start the FreeRTOS client runs a self-test of the port for about 2.2
seconds, the LED is on during the test. After the test:

- LED blinking at 1 Hz: all checks passed.
- LED blinking at 5 Hz: at least one check failed.

Fatal conditions terminate the sandbox, the host reports the exit code and
restarts it, so the LED goes back to steady on while the self-test runs again:

- `0xA5nnnnnn`: `configASSERT()` failed, `nnnnnn` is the line number.
- `0xA6000000`: task stack overflow.
- `0xA7000000`: FreeRTOS heap allocation failure.

If the serial port is assigned, the FreeRTOS client prints a banner on it at
start and the self-test result at the end of the test, then it echoes back
the received data, a line feed is added after each carriage return. Receive
errors and receive buffer overflows are reported as `<errors 0xnn>`, using
the `SB_VUART_EV_xxx` error bits. Ctrl-D stops the FreeRTOS scheduler using
`vTaskEndScheduler()`, `main()` returns and the sandbox terminates with exit
code `0x00000000`, then the host restarts it. The port is handled by a mini serial
driver based on FreeRTOS stream buffers, see
`demos/various/SB-CLIENT-FREERTOS/source/vserial.c`.

The RT XSHELL client also toggles VIO GPIO unit 0 from its blinker thread,
SB1 has no GPIO units assigned so those operations are ignored by the host.

## Build

From this directory:

```sh
make -j8
# Or select one target:
make -j8 -f make/stm32g474re_nucleo64.make
make -j8 -f make/stm32h563zi_nucleo144.make
```

The default goal of each target makefile also builds the sandbox images,
from their own projects, using the makefiles matching the target's sandbox
slots. The host output is `build/<target>/ch.elf`, the sandbox images are the
`sb.elf` files under the client projects' `build/<slot>/` directories. The
sandbox projects always use their own configuration and build directories,
also when the host ones are overridden on the command line.

The FPU is not used by default. `make USE_FPU=hard` builds the host with FPU
support and the sandbox images for the FPU, a host built with FPU support
also runs sandbox images not using it. Clean the host and the sandbox
projects when changing this option.

`make clean` cleans the host only. The sandbox images are cleaned from their
own projects.

## Flashing and debugging

The launch configurations under `debug/` connect to an OpenOCD server
started separately on `localhost:3333`, one set for each target:

- `(<target>)(OpenOCD, Flash and Run)`: erases both sandbox slots, loads the
  two sandbox images and the host image, debugs the host.
- `(<target>)(OpenOCD, Just Run)`: debugs the host without loading.
- `(SB1)` and `(SB2)` variants: same, using the symbols of the XSHELL or of
  the FreeRTOS sandbox image, execution stops at the sandbox `main()`.

The sandbox images are located relative to the project location using
`${workspace_loc:/RT-SB-SWITCHED-XSHELL-FREERTOS-MULTI}`, no paths need to be
edited. Build the target first, the configurations do not build the sandbox
projects separately.

Without the IDE all three images can be flashed using OpenOCD, for example on
the G474 target:

```sh
openocd -f board/st_nucleo_g4.cfg \
  -c "program build/stm32g474re_nucleo64/ch.elf verify" \
  -c "program ../../various/SB-CLIENT-RT-XHAL-XSHELL/build/128k-08040000-16k-20018000/sb.elf verify" \
  -c "program ../../various/SB-CLIENT-FREERTOS/build/128k-08060000-16k-2001C000/sb.elf verify reset exit"
```

## Adding targets

Add `make/<target>.make` and a self-contained `cfg/<target>/` with the RT,
XHAL, MCU, sandbox, VIO and VFS configurations plus `portab.c/h`. Define the
host serial port, the SB1 console SIO and the LED port and pad in `portab.h`,
optionally the SB2 serial port SIO as `PORTAB_SIO_SB2`.
Provide a linker script defining the host and the two sandbox regions, then
select the sandbox images matching those regions in the `sandboxes` rule of
the target makefile. Add a build configuration in `.cproject` and the launch
configurations under `debug/`. The top-level Makefile discovers target
`.make` files automatically.
